# Summary

This is a complete guide for the Code Implementation of our Project Report.

This report is to how to train a model to detect various emotions of a human.

The ipynb to train and test the model is :

[Human Emotion Detection System](https://github.com/santhoshcharan-001/Human-Emotion-Detection/blob/main/Human-Emotion-Detection/Human%20Emotion%20Detection.ipynb)

## Dependencies

Associated with this project, there is a file, "requirements.txt" which lists all libraries that need to be installed before to run the application.After creating Virtual env with **Python version 3.9.6**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Download the weights [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1noSZftAKEvyf4q5Nj8TwSYRBrB-pXjsF?usp=sharing)

copy and paste them in a new folder called Weights in this folder:

## Motivation

We are working towards a machine with emotions. A machine or a
system, which can think like humans, can feel warmness of heart; can
judge on events, prioritized between choices and with many more
emotional epithets. To make the dream reality first we need the
machine or system to understand human emotions, ape the emotion
and master it.
