# Human Emotion Detection System

## Description
Emotion recognition is the process of identifying human emotion. People vary widely in their accuracy at recognizing the emotions of others. Use of technology to help people with emotion recognition is a relatively nascent research area. Generally, the technology works best if it uses multiple modalities in context.

Facial expression recognition is one of the most powerful, natural and immediate means for human beings to communicate their emotions and intensions. Humans can be in some circumstances restricted from showing their emotions, such as hospitalized patients, or due to deficiencies; hence, better recognition of other human emotions will lead to effective communication.

So, our motive is to create a machine which can understand human emotions. And before the completion of project, we are going to learn how to create or train a machine which can understand human emotions. So, these were the things that made us to work on this project. Moreover Facial expression analysis is an
interesting and challenging problem and impacts important
applications in many areas, such as humanâ€“computer interactions and
medical applications.
